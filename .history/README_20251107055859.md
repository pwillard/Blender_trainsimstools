# TrainSimTools

**TrainSimTools** is a Blender add-on providing some tools for OpenRails content creators.

Version 1.3.3

- Fixed bug I re-introduced related to collection names.

### Features
- **Texture Filename Changer**
  - Swap directory, search/replace, mapping, or prefix/suffix updates.
  - Optional batch renaming of image datablocks.
- **Collection Tools**
  - Creates the standard `MAIN` / `Scratchpad` hierarchy.
  - Safe swap of collection names.
- **Fix UV MAP**
  - Often, when importing models from other formats, UV Maps are incompatible with the ORTS exporter.
  - This applies a simple fix to make sure the UV Map is named correctly.
